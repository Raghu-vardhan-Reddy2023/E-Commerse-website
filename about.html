                    <p>Product Listings: Detailed descriptions, images, and pricing for each product help customers make informed purchase decisions. Filters and search features are often used to help users find specific products.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shopping Cart: A virtual cart where customers can add products they wish to purchase and review them before checkout.
                    </p>

                    <p>Customer Reviews & Ratings: Provides social proof and helps new customers gain trust by reading the experiences of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Customer Support: Contact details, chatbots, or FAQ sections help users with questions or concerns about their purchases or the platform itself.
                    </p>
                    E-commerce websites can range from small business platforms to large-scale, multi-vendor marketplaces like Amazon, offering convenience and accessibility for both buyers and sellers.</p>
